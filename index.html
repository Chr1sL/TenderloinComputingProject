  <p> This story visualizer was created by Lick-Wilmerding High School students Christie Lum and Gabriel Juarez. It randomely loads and displays stories from the collection of over 300 text and sound stories! Thanks for your patience while it loads, though. It takes about 45 seconds. Hopefully by the time you finish reading this, it has loaded and you see a giant, blue EXPLORE A STORY button. You can click that button to randomely view a story! If it still hasn't loaded, close your eyes, think about the last weird experience you had in the Tenderloin, and when you reopen them, hopefully you see that blue button. Thanks for your patience and your interest! </p>
